##  Hello, I'm Tom 👋

🌐 Learning Full Stack Web Development | 🚀 Project Manager in IT | 🌟 System Transformation

### 👨‍💻About me

I've been managing system transformation projects over the last few years and having always had a keen interest in technology and a thirst for knowledge, I'm thrilled to have found a new passion in programming, while using the Odin project for my learning journey.

If i'm not working or studying, you'll find me with my two dogs Frank & Pablo. Failing that, I'll be at the gym, Jiu Jitsu or somewhere travelling!

### 🚀 My Progress

👨‍💻 I'm currently honing my skills with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), an excellent resource for aspiring web developers. This curriculum has a clear focus on problem solving, using documentation and building projects.

Some of my projects so far: 

-[Etch a Sketch](https://github.com/TomJS14/etch-a-sketch):  This was my first project with a good deal of DOM manipulation
-[Calculator](https://github.com/TomJS14/calculator): UI Design, a little Math and event delegation. I enjoyed this one!
-[To Do](https://github.com/TomJS14/to-do): Working with local storage, UI design and modular code structuring
-[Sign up form](https://github.com/TomJS14/user-form): Form Validation, and a little CSS trickery / animations.
-[Weather App](https://github.com/TomJS14/weather-app): Working with API's, Async functions and promises
-[Knight Travails](https://github.com/TomJS14/knight-travails): Working with data structures and algorithms to find the shortest path for a knight to travel across the chess board.

### 🌱 What I'm currently working on

I'm currently working on my Battleship game for my final Javascript project, I am also working with Jest for this project to put into practice what I've learnt about TDD (Test driven development)



### 🛠️ Some of the technologies I've been working with include:
