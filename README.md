#  Hello, I'm Tom 👋

🌐 Learning Full Stack Web Development | 🚀 Project Manager in IT | 🌟 Digital Transformation



## 👨‍💻About me

I've been managing system transformation projects over the last few years and having always had a keen interest in technology, I'm thrilled to have found a new passion in programming/web development, while using the Odin project for my learning journey.

If i'm not working or studying, you'll find me with my two dogs Frank & Pablo. Failing that, I'll be at the gym, Jiu Jitsu or hopefully somewhere travelling!



## 🚀 My Progress

👨‍💻 I'm currently honing my skills with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), an excellent resource for aspiring web developers. This curriculum has a clear focus on problem solving, using documentation and building projects.

Some of my projects so far: 

- [Etch a Sketch](https://tomjs14.github.io/etch-a-sketch):  This was my first project with a good deal of DOM manipulation
- [Calculator](https://tomjs14.github.io/calculator): UI Design, a little Math and event delegation. I enjoyed this one!
- [To Do](https://tomjs14.github.io/to-do/): Working with local storage, UI design and modular code structuring
- [Sign up form](https://tomjs14.github.io/sign-up-form/): Form Validation, and a little CSS trickery / animations.
- [Weather App](https://tomjs14.github.io/weather-app/): Working with API's, Async functions and promises
- [Knight Travails](https://github.com/TomJS14/knight-travails): Working with data structures and algorithms to find the shortest path for a knight to travel across the chess board.
- [Battleship](https://tomjs14.github.io/battleships/): A drag and drop battleships game. (Set up for horizontal play only for now)
- [CV-Generator](https://main--resilient-creponne-61313e.netlify.app/): A react based app for generating a CV, use of state to update components as required.
- [Rick & Morty Memory card game](https://memorycard-rick.netlify.app/): A react based memory card game using a Rick and Morty API, more state, more transitions and component use!

  

## 🌱 What I'm currently working on

I'm now working through learning React and have built a few React based apps, I'm currently learning how to test within React.
